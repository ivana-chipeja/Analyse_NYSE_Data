# Analyse_NYSE_Data

In this project I analysed real life data from the New York Stock Exchange of a subset of a large dataset provided by (Kaggle)[https://www.kaggle.com/dgawlik/nyse] that contains historical financial data from S&P 500 companies.

## Introduction to the project

For the final project, we were tasked to conduct three Tasks:

1. Complete our own data analysis and create a presentation to share our findings.
2. Develop a Profit and Loss Statement dashboard.
3. Create a Financial Forecasting Model using three scenarios.

We also had to choose a sub-category and company that we wanted to focus our data analysis on, and then use a spreadsheet application like Google Sheets or Excel to conduct the analysis of the sub-category and company of our choice.


### Task 1:

After familiarizing ourselves with the data set, we needed identify the question that we would answer based on our data analysis of summary statistics and include this in our slide presentation.

- Our question should include at least one categorical variable and one quantitative variable and require the use of at least one of the summary statistics.
- Create a tab within the spreadsheet file that included the summary statistics. These are the measures of central tendency (mean, median) and the measures of spread (standard deviation and range) we used to answer our question.


### Task 2:

- Create a tab with a dashboard for a Profit and Loss (P&L) statement that calculates the **Gross Profit, Operating Profit, or EBIT** for a company.
- The dashboard had to be dynamic, meaning that **there should be a drop-down list for ticker symbol selection** that includes all companies from the data set.
- The P&L statement had to be updated with the historical data for all the years of the selected company in the drop-down list.

### Task 3:

- Create a tab with a dashboard for a financial model for a company (different from Task 2) of our choice that **forecasts out the Gross Profit, Operating Profit, or EBIT for two more years** using three scenarios.
- The forecasting model should include a **drop-down list for selecting a Strong case, a Base case, and a Weak case**. Making the results of the forecast years dynamic.
- Our assumptions for revenue growth, gross margin, and operating margin should change for each scenario.
- This dashboard, however, could be static for the chosen ticker symbol (no drop-down list for the ticker symbol is required).

### Task 4:

- We had to download the submission template (PowerPoint or Google Slides)
- Once we finished analysing the data, we had to create our presentation in the provided template, sharing the visual and summary statistics insights.
- The summary information paragraph should clearly communicate our findings based on our analysis and provide visual or numeric values associated with your summary.
- The visualization(s) might be a bar chart, histogram, scatterplot, box plot, or other visual that we learned to make.

## Final Submission

I had a lot of issues finishing this work because this was my first time diving this deep into Excel and had a little trouble summarising my findings.
